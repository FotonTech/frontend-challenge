# FotonTech Frontend Challenge

Frontend Challenge for Foton

Check out the challenge document (at the time it was done) [here](https://github.com/FotonTech/frontend-challenge/blob/49f345620d0198ffbb1fc48b3587792dcdad5b11/README.md)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Installation

NodeJS and NPM should be installed on your machine for development mode. Install it using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

1. install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
# or
npm install
```

## Getting Started

1. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

2. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
